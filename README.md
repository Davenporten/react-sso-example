# React SSO example

Note: This "Proof of Concept" is designed only on Windows OS.

To run this example:

```
cd back
npm i
npm start

cd ../front
npm i
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Hope the interface is intuitive.

It demonstrates a SSO connection.
The front is written with React and Redux, and the back with Express.
